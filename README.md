# Coffee Machine

This is a terminal application which represents a basic Coffee Machine which I have built in 2017 when I was learning C. This command application was built with the concept of using a state machine flow.

### Prerequisites

All you need is a compiler, if memory serves correct, I used the [QT MinGW Compiler](https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW) in 2017.
